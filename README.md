# SmartMirror
The project describes design, construction and working of the smart mirror. Smart mirror is one of applications of Raspberry pi and the IOT technology. The Raspberry pi stays at back scenes and controls the data displayed on mirror, while looking at mirror you can look at various notifications like date, day, weather and much more. Raspberry pi interfaces the hardware components with it. All the software codes are implemented. Such mirrors can be programmed to work as control home appliances by touch screen. The Raspberry pi is connected to monitor via HDMI as well as it also has inbuilt Wi-Fi interfaces so we can just touch the screen to play music and videos to mirror
